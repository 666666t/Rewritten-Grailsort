Note from DeveloperSort (ASimpleBeginner#7755):

This is depreceated and has no actual useful files.
I've changed my name from **Bee sort** to **DeveloperSort**, so all original data from `Bee sort's Rewritten Grailsort for Java` are moved to `DeveloperSort's Rewritten Grailsort for Java`

Not sure how to properly delete this folder, though...
